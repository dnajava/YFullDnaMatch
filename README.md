# YFullDnaMatch

This is not a right source code. I programmed such program years ago and had miracle results to two person which common ancestor fahter was about 2000 B.C.E. I try to find the right file from my hard disk.

Added 15th March 2021 python code to do same task. First copy+paste SNP and STR lists from YFull to plain text editor or spreadsheet. Then save as .csv. And then use this program.
